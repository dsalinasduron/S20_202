    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Quiz 1 Review</span><br>
    <br>
    This first quiz will take approximately 20 minutes to complete. It
    will consist of a few multiple choice, as well as short answer
    questions. This will not involve any programming on the computer,
    and all answers will be handwritten. The quiz will cover material
    through Big-Oh notation and general concepts of linked lists.<br>
    <br>
    The best way to prepare for this quiz is to review all labs as well
    as the first two homework assignments. In addition, notes that are
    posted on the course website are also helpful. Perhaps a good
    starting point is to review the in-class quiz we did on the first
    day of class.<br>
    <br>
    Be familiar with the following topics:<br>
    <br>
    - Static methods and static data.<br>
    <br>
    - Inheritance including the relationship between parent and child
    classes.<br>
    <br>
    - Interfaces and how they support polymorphism.<br>
    <br>
    - Linked lists.<br>
    <br>
    - Scope rules including public and private visibility.<br>
    <br>
    - '==' vs 'equals()'<br>
    <br>
    - Difference between O(1) and O(n)<br>
    <br>
    This seems like quite a bit, but really it is an emphasis of what
    you have been programming the first month of class, and if you have
    been comfortable with the programming concepts, you should be
    reasonably-well prepared.<br>
