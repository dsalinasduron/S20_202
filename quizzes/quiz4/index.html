    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Quiz 4 Review</span><br>
    <br>
    We will have our fourth and final quiz on Monday December 9,
    2019.&nbsp; It will consist of a few multiple choice, as well as
    short answer questions. This will not involve any programming on the
    computer, and all answers will be handwritten. The quiz will be
    comprehensive and cover material throughout the semester.<br>
    <br>
    The best way to prepare for this quiz is to&nbsp; review the first
    three quizzes. I will include <b>at least </b>1 question from each
    of the first 3 quizzes on our this quiz.<br>

          style="font-family: monospace;">equals()</span></big>' as well
