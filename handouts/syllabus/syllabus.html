<table>
<tr><td>Mondays</td><td>10-11:50 a.m.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Wednesdays</td><td>9-11:50 a.m.</td></tr>
</table> 
</p>

<a class="section">Instructor</a> 

<p>The instructor for this course is Daniel Salinas Duron, currently in Gore
111. His office hours are:
<table>
<tr><td>Mondays</td><td>2-5 p.m.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Tuesdays</td><td>10-12 a.m.</td></tr>
</table> 

<a class="section">Course Description</a>

<p>An exploration of fundamental data structures including stacks, queues,
trees, graphs, and dictionaries will be covered using the Java programming
language. An introduction to formal algorithmic complexity that compares and
contrasts different algorithmic designs will also be covered.</p>

<a class="section">Course Objectives</a>

<p>On successful completion of this course you will have better problem solving
skills, be able to design and implement algorithms and analyze algorithmic
complexity for solving a problem, and be comfortable programming with several
data structures, including their appropriate usage. This course should prepare
you to continue with more advanced computer studies and writing more
substantial programs.</p> 

<a class="section">Prerequisites</a>

<b>CMPT 201</b>. You need to be familiar with Java syntax and basic programming
skills. Basic algebra skills are also expected.

<a class="section">Topics</a>

<p> We will cover the following topics this semester. A common theme for these
topics is the separation of abstraction and implementation.

<ol>
<li>Java interfaces</li>
<li>Data structures (sets, lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs,
dictionaries)</li>
<li>Unit testing</li>
<li>Algorithmic complexity using Big-Oh notation</li>
</ol>
</p> 

<a class="section">Coursework</a>

<a class="subsection">Labs<a>

<p>We will have one lab each week. Each lab will have one or more <b>learning
goals</b>. Comprehension of the learning goals will determine the lab's grade.
The four grade levels are detailed below.<b>If you submit your work at least
one day before the due date you will be provided feedback and be allowed to
resubmit it.</b></p>

<p>
<b>E</b>: Excellent. The work demonstrates a thorough understanding of the
material. It is complete, correct, and utilizes good programming principles.
</p> 

<p><b>M</b>: Meets expectations. The student comprehends both the problem and
the solution. There may be minor (e.g. off-by-one) errors or incompletions.</p> 
<p><b>R</b>: Needs revisions. The student's solution is functional and
demonstrates a partial grasp of the learning objectives. However, there remain
significant gaps in their understanding.</p> 

<p>
<b>N</b>: Not assessable. The work is severely incomplete or not functional.
There are too many issues to justify feedback on every one.
</p> 


<a class="subsection">Homework</a>

<p>There will be several homework assignments, for which you will have one to
three weeks to complete. Homework assignments will be appropriately weighted
based upon the amount of work required.  You may hand in assignments late with
the penalty of 5% per day (weekends count as one day). A grading rubric will
be provided on the Canvas dropbox for each homework assignment.</p>

<p> Late allowances will be made for serious illnesses and emergencies. If you
must turn in an assignment late, make arrangements in advance or notify me as
soon as possible.</p>

<a class="subsection">Grading</a>

<p>Programming and lab assignments will be graded using the following criteria:
<ol>

<li><b>Correctness & Completeness</b> Does your solution correctly satisfy all
stated requirements?</li>

<li><b>Readability</b> Do you use good class, method, and variable names and
have well formatted code with proper comments and documentation?</li>

<li><b>Testing and Debugging</b> Is your code properly tested and debugged?
This last step is often the difference between a A and a B grade in this
class.</li>

</ol>
</p>

<a class="subsection">Ethics Presentations</a>

<p> Students will pair up to give a presentation on ethical issues related to
computer science. As a team, you should explain the issue to the class. Then
each student should present one side of the ethical conflict. You will also
turn in a one-page summary of your topic.  </p>

<a class="subsection">In-class Activities</a>

<p>We will have a variety of in-class activities that involve working with a
partner as you investigate and analyze how various data structures and
algorithms work, are manipulated, and how they are evaluated. Completing these
activities requires being prepared, attending class, and being an active and
engaging participant.</p>

<a class="subsection">Quizzes</a>

<p>Quizzes will be given in class as we finish topics. Their purpose is to
encourage regular study. There will be  four quizzes. The lowest quiz score
will not be dropped. Quizzes will be announced in advance.</p>

<a class="subsection">Final Quiz</a>

<p>A cumulative final quiz will be  held the last week of classes.</p>

<a class="subsection">Course Grade</a>

<p>Your course grade will be determine according to the following policy:

<table>
<tr>
<td>Topic </td><td> Weight  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Labs </td><td> 35%  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Homework </td><td> 35%  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ethics Presentation  </td><td> 2%  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Quizzes (3 @ 6% each) </td><td> 18%   </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Final Quiz </td><td> 10%  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Total </td><td> 100% </td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Your grade will be determined using the following scale.</p>
<table>
<tr><td> &gt 93 </td><td>  A </td></tr>
<tr><td> 90 .. 93 </td><td>  A- </td></tr>
<tr><td> 88 .. 89 </td><td>  B+ </td></tr>
<tr><td> 83 .. 87 </td><td>  B </td></tr>
<tr><td> 80 .. 82 </td><td>  B- </td></tr>
<tr><td> 78 .. 79 </td><td>  C+ </td></tr>
<tr><td> 73 .. 77 </td><td>  C </td></tr>
<tr><td> 70 .. 72 </td><td>  C- </td></tr>
<tr><td> 65 .. 69 </td><td>  D+ </td></tr>
<tr><td> 60 .. 64 </td><td>  D </td></tr>
<tr><td> 55 .. 59 </td><td>  D- </td></tr>
<tr><td> &lt 55 </td><td> Fail </td></tr>
</table>

<p><b>The instructor reserves the right to alter the above grading scheme. Any
modifications will be announced to the class.</b></p>


<a class="subsection">Attendance and Class Participation</a>

<p>Although not part of your grade, attendance and class participation are
crucial for your success in this class! You are expected to attend class, and
be prepared to participate in the activities of each class period. I will
subjectively use attendance and participation to decide your final grade in
addition to points. Regular attendance and positive participation will shift
your grade upward if you are on the edge of a category. Similarly, poor
attendance and negative participation (e.g., arriving late, expressing a
negative attitude, showing disrespect or poor manners toward other students or
the instructor, talking in class, cheating, etc.) will shift your grade
downward.</p>

<a class="subsection">Group Work</a>

<p>You are encouraged to work together in designing a solution to a homework or
lab problem, but all answers and programming code should be your own work.
Please list in the README all students you worked with on each assignment.
Cheating is not tolerated. A first cheating offense will earn a negative grade
on the assignment, quiz, or exam, and a second offense will receive a failing
grade for the course and a letter to your advisor. Please refer to the Academic
Catalog or the Student Handbook for the College's statement on academic
honesty.</p>

<a class="subsection">College-Wide Learning Goals</a>

<p><b>Title IX</b> of the Education Amendments of 1972 prohibits sex
discrimination against any participant in an educational program or activity
that receives federal funds. Westminster is committed to providing a safe and
non-discriminatory learning, living, and working environment to all members of
the Westminster community and does not discriminate on the basis of sex. This
includes on the basis of gender, gender identity, gender expression,
nonconformity with gender stereotypes, or sexual orientation. The College's
Title IX policy strictly prohibits sexual assault, sexual harassment,
gender-based harassment, gender-based discrimination, sexual exploitation,
interpersonal violence (dating violence, domestic violence, stalking), and
retaliation for making a good faith report of prohibited conduct or
participating in any proceeding under the policy. The policy and accompanying
procedures are available <a
href="https://www.westminstercollege.edu/about/resources/title-ix">here</a>,
they and discuss prohibited conduct, resources, reporting, supportive measures,
rights, investigations, and sanctions for violations of the policy.</p>


<p>If you want to make a report of prohibited conduct, you may contact
Westminster's Title IX Coordinator, Kat Thomas, or report an incident online.
Kat can be reached at kthomas at westminstercollege dot edu, 801-832-2262, or
in Malouf 107. You can also contact Deputy Coordinator Traci Siriprathane at
tsiriprathane at westminstercollege dot edu, or 801-832-2862, or in HWAC 210.
Please note that to the extent permitted by law, the College aims to protect
the privacy of all parties involved in the investigation and resolution of
reported violations of the policy. However, the College has a duty to look into
and take actions in response to reports and cannot guarantee confidentiality or
that an investigation will not be pursued.  The Counseling Center is a
confidential resource, and by law the counselors who work there cannot reveal
confidential information to any third party without express permission unless
there is an imminent threat of harm to self or others. <b>As an instructor I am
a responsible employee and am required to report any information I obtain
regarding conduct that may violate the policy to the Title IX Coordinator so
that students can receive supportive measures and referrals to resources, they
are aware of their options, and the safety of the campus community can be
ensured.</b> If you begin to disclose an incident of prohibited conduct, I may
interrupt you because I want to make sure that you have had the opportunity to
discuss the incident with confidential resources on and off campus first.  If
you need supportive measures inside or outside the classroom because of an
incident of prohibited conduct, please reach out to the Title IX Coordinator
for assistance. </p>

<p><b>Title VI</b> of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination
based on race, color, or national origin in any program or activity receiving
federal financial assistance. In addition to these, Westminster's Equal
Opportunity policy prohibits discrimination or harassment based on ethnicity,
age, religion, military status, or genetic information in any of its programs
or activities. If you encounter this type of discrimination or harassment, or
feel that you have been retaliated against for reporting prohibited conduct or
participating in any related proceeding, you can contact the Equal Opportunity
Administrator, Westminster's Title IX Coordinator, Kat Thomas, or report an
incident online. Kat can be reached at kthomas at westminstercollege dot edu,
